This repository serves as a quick reference for Swift code examples, designed to help developers understand key concepts and techniques in Swift programming. **While this is not an exhaustive source of truth, it provides practical documentation and examples** that can assist you in your learning journey. Each example focuses on a specific topic and includes code snippets with detailed explanations.


## Project Overview

This project provides:
- **Code Snippets**: Self-contained examples of Swift functions and codes.
- **Explanations**: Each topic contains a readme file to help explain the codes or concepts.
- **Organized by Topics**: Each snippet is grouped into folders by category (e.g., Concurrency, Patterns) for easy navigation.

## Topics Covered

Here’s a list of the main categories covered in this repository:

### [Pattern Matching and Destructuring](./Patterns/README.md)
- This section includes various examples that showcase how to use pattern matching with `switch`, `if let`, and `guard` statements, as well as destructuring tuples and enums.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the Topics**: Navigate through folders to explore specific topics.
2. **Review the Code and Explanation**: Each folder contains a Swift file and a `README.md` explaining how the code works.
3. **Run the Code**: Some snippets can be tested in Xcode Playgrounds for hands-on practice.
