## Naming Type Parameters

Choosing good names for your type parameters is crucial for making your generic code more readable and understandable. Here are some guidelines to follow:

**Descriptive Names:**

* **When There's a Clear Relationship:**  Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the role of the type parameter in the context of the generic type or function. 

   - **Example:** `Dictionary<Key, Value>` uses `Key` and `Value` to immediately tell you what those type parameters represent.
   - **Example:** `Array<Element>` uses `Element` to indicate that it's a placeholder for the type of element the array will store.

* **When the Relationship is Less Obvious:**  Use descriptive names that still convey the general purpose of the type parameter, even if it's not a standard term like `Key` or `Value`.

   - **Example:**  You might use `ItemType` for a generic function that operates on items of any type.

**Traditional Single-Letter Names:**

* **When There's No Meaningful Relationship:** When a type parameter doesn't have a clear relationship to the generic type or function, it's common practice to use single-letter names like `T`, `U`, or `V`.

   - **Example:**  The `swapTwoValues<T>` function used a `T` because the type parameter is just a placeholder for any type.

**Important Note:**

* **Upper Camel Case:**  Always use **upper camel case** for type parameter names (like `T`, `MyTypeParameter`, `ItemType`). This convention distinguishes them as type placeholders, not values.

**Here's a table summarizing the naming conventions:**

| Situation                               | Name Example | Explanation                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clear Relationship between type parameter and context | `Key`, `Value`  | Indicates the specific role of the type parameter.                            |
| Less Obvious Relationship               | `ItemType`     | Conveys a general purpose, even if not a standard term.                      |
| No Meaningful Relationship              | `T`, `U`, `V`  |  Used as a simple placeholder, indicating a lack of specific association.      |

By following these naming conventions, you can significantly improve the clarity and readability of your generic code, making it easier for both yourself and others to understand.
