# Project Overview

This project serves as a quick reference to various patterns in Swift, providing practical examples and explanations to help developers understand and implement these concepts effectively. Each section will cover a specific pattern type, detailing its usage, syntax, and potential applications.

Each file contains a standalone example that can be run or tested independently.

## Patterns in Swift

### Introduction to Patterns

In Swift, a **pattern** represents the structure of a single value or a composite value. For instance, the structure of a tuple such as `(1, 2)` is defined as a comma-separated list of two elements. Because patterns represent the general structure of a value rather than a specific instance, they can match a variety of values. For example, the pattern `(x, y)` will successfully match the tuple `(1, 2)` as well as any other two-element tuple.

Patterns are not just for matching; they also allow you to extract parts of a composite value and bind each part to a constant or variable name. This capability is especially useful in destructuring complex data types and makes your code more readable and maintainable.

### Types of Patterns

In Swift, there are two basic categories of patterns:

1. **Destructuring Patterns**: These patterns successfully match any kind of value and are used for variable, constant, and optional bindings. This category includes:
   - **Wildcard patterns** (e.g., `_`)
   - **Identifier patterns** (e.g., `x`)
   - **Value binding patterns** (e.g., `let x = ...`)
   - **Tuple patterns** (e.g., `(x, y)`)

   You can specify a type annotation for these patterns to constrain them to match only values of a certain type.

2. **Full Pattern Matching**: These patterns are used when the values you are trying to match may not be present at runtime. They include:
   - **Enumeration case patterns**
   - **Optional patterns**
   - **Expression patterns**
   - **Type-casting patterns**

   These patterns are typically used in the context of `switch` statements, `catch` clauses in `do` statements, or in conditionals of `if`, `while`, `guard`, or `for-in` statements.

## Patterns Covered

- **[WildCard Pattern](./WildCard%20Pattern/README.md)**: Demonstrates how to ignore values in a match.
- **[Identifier Pattern](./Identifier%20Pattern/README.md)**: Matches and binds a value to a variable.
- **[Value Binding Pattern](./Value%20Binding%20Pattern/README.md)**: Unwraps an optional value using binding.
- **[Tuple Pattern](./Tuple%20Pattern/README.md)**: Matches values in a tuple.
- **[Enum Case Pattern](./Enum%20Case%20Pattern/README.md)**: Matches enum cases to execute specific code.
- **[Optional Pattern](./Optional%20Pattern/README.md)**: Checks for nil or a value in an optional.
- **[Type Casting Pattern](./Type%20Casting%20Pattern/README.md)**: Uses type casting to handle objects of different types.
- **[Expression Pattern](./Expression%20Pattern/README.md)**: Matches values based on conditions.
